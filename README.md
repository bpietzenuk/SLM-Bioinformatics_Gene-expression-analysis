# SLM Bioinformatics: Gene expression analysis using A. thaliana heat stress data
This set of reference data and a commenting manual can be used to support the self-learning of bioinformatic applications. It teaches the practical use of next-generation sequencing data to investigate gene regulation at the transcriptome level, using the example of heat responsive genes in A. thaliana.
